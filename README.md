## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

I developed this chalenge in React using components and CSS for the styles. It was so useful to understand the HTML elements as section, articles and button.

Also, it was very useful to understand Flexbox to organize the different components of the User Interface and the use of media queries to switch between desktop and mobile versions.

it was interesting to learn about resources as [https://fontawesome.com/] and his interaction with react.

Regarding how work this challenge in react, I used a unique component "Card"just to organize the different elements without any other functionality cause of the scope of this challenge.

### Continued development

I would like to continue developing this challenges using React as main resource and complementing with other ones as HTML5, CSS, SAAS, Bootstrap, Tailwind among others.
